## Exhibitions


- *Your Daily Rainbow v3*, Interactive Software Installation, Your Daily Rainbow started with my curiosity about Facebook’s “Celebrate Pride” image filtering algorithm after the U.S. Supreme Court decision recognizing the constitutionality of same-sex marriage. One of the more interesting aspects of the filter was that it didn’t use the original colors of the pride flag (to keep the photo underneath visible). To get the values of the modified colors, I did a series of experiments and set them as my Facebook profile picture for one day. The version presented here is a compilation of the filters presented for *Out of Context* in 2017, collected together in one piece, and functioning as a sort of photo booth installation. I made significant changes to the backend software to allow visitors to snap photos of themselves, enter their email address, and have the photo sent as an email attachment, all without additional web browser plugins., Invited Group Exhibition, *Out of Site*, Philly Tech Week, Twenty-Two Gallery, Philadelphia, PA, 2019

The participating new media artists will showcase their work for another immersive limited engagement, live for DesignPhiladelphia 2019 at Twenty-Two Gallery's new lower-level space.

Ongoing work on *Fresh Start - An Interactive Video Game With Narrative Immersion to Promote Mindful Drinking Among College Freshmen*. *Fresh Start* is a narrative-based interactive video game that prepares TCNJ freshmen to make healthy decisions related to alcohol consumption. This project is an innovative interdisciplinary collaboration that involves faculty and students from Communication Studies, Interactive Multimedia, Public Health, and staff from Student Affairs, and has the potential to be adopted as part of TCNJ’s mandatory alcohol education program.
